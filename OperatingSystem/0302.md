### System Protection

- Dual Mode Protection （雙模保護）
    - User Mode（使用者模式） : can not effect core stuffs
    - Monitor Mode（監督者模式） / Supervisor Mode / System Mode / Kernel Mode / Privileged Mode / Protect Mode : The commands used in monitor mode are called " Privileged Instruction ".  halt system, turn interrupt on / off, and change mode, plus all i/o commands
    - Super User（超級使用者） : can login or switch to monitor mode, able to access system settings

### Batch Systems

- When computer opens, usually use batch systems to deal with some original settings.

## Off Line / On Line

- off : not connect with computer, not controlled by center processor
- on : connect with computer, controlled by center processor / not necessarily real time

## Multiprogramming

- Simultaneously, multiple programs are processing by center processor, plus some programs(the processing ones) will need to wait for the resources(for ex, I /O).
- not necessarily be time sharing system

## Throughput

- The number of processes that completes per time unit.

## Time Sharing System

- must by Multiprogramming
- slice time : )
- programs —> block queue(wait for the fetch),  central operating system —>waiting queue (fetch)

## Spooling

- Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On Line, a.k.a. Spooling
- It has its special sharing device.

## Response Time

- From the submission of the request until the first response is produced.

## Real Time System

- Because it has to response immediately, so it's " On Line ".
- response quickly / return correct results within the defined constraints.
- HARD real time : turnaround time
- SOFT real time : response time
